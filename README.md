# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to apply Excel skills learned in module 1 to a real life situation. The project was an extension of the scenario developed throughout module 1 and focused on both displaying taught skills as well as developing new ideas.

In terms of practicing skills introduced throughout the module, this project requires the use of

- applying filters
- creating Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
- creating and naming new sheets

An example of a Piviot Chart created from a Pivot Table is shown below

Charts such as these help to visualize the data being presented to a client. In this case the chart plots the initial goal of the campaign on the x-axis vs the percentage of successful campaigns on the y-axis. In this case it shows that in most cases a lower initial goal will potentially lead to a more successful campaign.

Some new skills not explicitly taught are

- COUNTIFS functions
- SUM functions

An example of the code for a COUNTIFS function in Excel is highlighted below

`=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$F:$F,"successful",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays",Kickstarter!$D:$D,">=1000",Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<5000")`

 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
